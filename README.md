## Welcome to Foundation Model for Breast Cancer MRI (FM-LCT).

FM-LCT is a vertical foundation model for quantitative MRI analysis in lung cancer. FM-LCT is trained on a diverse dataset covering various breast cancer types and stages, and it undergoes meticulous data preprocessing, ensuring optimal input quality. Harnessing advanced deep learning techniques (contrastive learning algorithms), the model extracts deep learning-based features from CT scans, unveiling crucial insights into morphological features, shape characteristics, and texture features. Positioned for versatile applications in both research and clinical realms, it empowers researchers with nuanced data exploration and provides healthcare professionals with support for informed decision-making.

The FM-LCT is designed and developed by Dr.Zhenwei Shi, Zhihe Zhao, Zhitao Wei, Dr.Chu Han and other AI/CS scientists from [Media Lab](https://github.com/GDPHMediaLab). Also, the work is supported and guided by experienced radiologists Prof. MD Zaiyi Liu and Prof. MD Changhong Liang from the radiolgoy department of Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital.

The FM-LCT model was pre-trained by using constrative learning algorithms (Figure A). The FM-BCMRI can be implemented to specific use cases by extracting quantitative imaging features or by task-specitic fine-tuning (Figure B).
